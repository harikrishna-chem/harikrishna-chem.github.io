            <p> Research Scientist II, Georgia Tech, USA </p>
            <p> Dr. Sahu joined Georgia Tech as a postdoc in September 2019.  Prior to joining Georgia Tech, he was a postdoc
                fellow at Nanjing University, China. He received his M.Sc. degree in Chemistry at National Institute of Technology
                Rourkela and a Ph.D. degree in computational chemistry at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. His research focuses
                on developing and applying computational and machine learning tools to accelerate materials discovery.

          <h1> Notable Contributions </h1>  
          <p> My research mostly contributes to the development of organic materials for next-generation electronic devices. </p>

                <h2>Polymer Structure Predictor </h2>
                <p> PSP is an autonomous polymer model generator, to build a hierarchy of polymer models, ranging from oligomers to
                    infinite chains to crystals to amorphous models, using simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings
                    of polymers. Being a first of its kind, it will facilitate automation in polymer property prediction and design.

                <h2> Organic Solar Cell </h2>
                <p>
                    High performing machine learning models are established to predict the PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF, using relevant quantum
                    chemical properties of donor/acceptor materials in organic solar cells. This study demonstrates how to design organic materials
                    for a specific photovoltaic application.

                <h2> Conducting Polymer </h2>
                <p>
                    Conjugated polymers with high electrical conductivity are beneficial for thermoelectrics applications. Machine learning models
                    are established to predict the electrical conductivity of p-doped polymers. Five hundred promising candidates are selected by performing
                    high-throughput virtual screening of 845,000 candidates. New design guidelines are also established.
